        <h3 class="text-heading">ABOUT TEDX, X = INDEPENDENTLY ORGANIZED EVENT</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share
            a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
            connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
            The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
            (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

        <h3 class="text-heading">ABOUT TED</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years
            ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the
            world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
            free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
            Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

            where new TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as
            well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious
            Project that takes a collaborative approach to funding ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling
            scale; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the
            world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact
            of their remarkable projects and activities.
