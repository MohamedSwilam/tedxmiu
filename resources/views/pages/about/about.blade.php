        <h3 class="text-heading">ABOUT TEDX, X = INDEPENDENTLY ORGANIZED EVENT</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share
            a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
            connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event.
            The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
            (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

        <h3 class="text-heading">ABOUT TED</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years
            ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the
            world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
            free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
            Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

            well as translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious
            Project that takes a collaborative approach to funding ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling
            scale; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the
            world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact

                    <p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system. As a result of this law, most of the popular online casino networks such as Party Gaming and PlayTech left the United States. Overnight, online casino players found themselves being chased by the Federal government. But, after a fortnight, the online casino industry came up with a solution and new online casinos started taking root. These began to operate under a different business umbrella, and by doing that, rendered the transfer of money to and from them legal. A major part of this was enlisting electronic banking systems that would accept this new clarification and start doing business with me. Listed in this article are the electronic banking systems that accept players from the United States that wish to play in online casinos.</p>
